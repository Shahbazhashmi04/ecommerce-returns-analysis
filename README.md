# E-Commerce Returns & Profitability Analysis

This is one of my data science learning projects where I analyzed how product returns affect an e-commerce company's overall profitability. The goal was to find out which factors (like category, region, and discounts) contribute most to losses and how we can improve business performance.

---

## Project Goal

In this project, I wanted to:
- Calculate the overall return rate and profit loss
- Identify categories and regions with the highest returns
- Understand how discounts impact return behavior
- Suggest practical ways to reduce losses and improve profit margins

---

## Key Insights

After cleaning and analyzing the data, I found:
- Overall return rate: **17.7%**
- Most common return reason: **Size Issue**
- Total profit lost due to returns: **$45,556.92**
- Highest loss categories: **Home** and **Beauty**
- North region had the highest return-related losses
- Higher discounts (>20%) led to more returns

## What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
- **Data cleaning** and handling missing values  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with Pandas and Matplotlib  
- Building a **profitability dashboard** using groupby and KPIs  
- Interpreting data to make **business recommendations**

---

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab (for coding and visualization)

---
## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter  
3. Upload the dataset  
4. Run all cells to see the full analysis and results

---

## Dataset
The dataset is **synthetic** (created for learning purposes) and contains columns like product category, price, cost, discount, region, return reason, and profit metrics.

---

## Next Steps
In the future, Iâ€™d like to:
- Build a simple machine learning model to **predict product returns**
- Create an interactive dashboard using **Plotly** or **Power BI**

## Acknowledgment
I built this project as part of my data science learning journey, with some guidance from online resources and AI tools. All the analysis, interpretation, and insights were done by me.
